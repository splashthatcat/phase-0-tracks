				*What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
					*Semantic tags tell the browser what to do. I personally like the table tage. It's very useful.
				*What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
					*The browser display elements from top to bottom.
				*What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
					*We learned how to create snippets. Well, I learned how. It didn't quite work for me. 
				*Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
					*If I was a good development, then I should.
				*What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
					*I'm still stuck on the snippet thing. I'll researching it now.
		So please read it -->
