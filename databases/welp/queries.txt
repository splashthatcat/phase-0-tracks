1.) In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt. Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt, along with the output from your database.

Done.

2.) Youâ€™ve joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * FROM  businesses INNER JOIN users ON reviews

Moe's Burgers|119 Lake Street
Suicide Blonde|200 Rivers Drive
1|5|I love Moe's!|1|1
2|4|I love Suicide Blonde's selection.|2|2
David Wu|11
Maria Diaz|39

3.) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT names FROM users INNER JOIN business_name FROM businesses INNER JOIN stars comment ON reviews

Suicide Blonde|200 
5|I love Moe's!|
4|I love Suicide Blonde's selection.|

4.) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT business_name1 business_address1  FROM businesses  INNER JOIN reviews ON stars1 comment1

Moe's Burgers|119 Lake Street|5|I love Moe's!|
